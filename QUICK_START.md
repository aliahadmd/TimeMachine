## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Can't push to GitHub
```bash
# Solution: Check remote URL
git remote -v

# If wrong, update it
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/aliahadmd/TimeManager.git
```

### Problem: "Failed to push tag"
```bash
# Solution: Push main branch first
git push origin main

# Then push tags
git push origin --tags
```

### Problem: "Large files rejected"
```bash
# Solution: Build folder and keystore should be gitignored
# Check .gitignore is working
git status

# Remove if accidentally staged
git rm --cached -r app/build
git rm --cached app/release-keystore.jks
```
