# Focus Tracker - Bug Fixes & Improvements Summary

## 🐛 Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Session Not Showing After Completion** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** After finishing a 1-minute session, it showed 0m everywhere.

**Root Cause:**
- Session was being saved to database correctly
- UI wasn't refreshing after save because there was no recomposition trigger
- `LaunchedEffect` dependencies weren't set up to react to new data

**Solution:**
- Added `refreshTrigger` state variable that increments after session save
- Wrapped summary cards with `key(refreshTrigger)` to force recomposition
- Changed database operations to use `Dispatchers.IO` for proper threading
- Used `withContext(Dispatchers.Main)` to update UI state safely
- Added comprehensive logging to track session saves

**Code Changes:**
```kotlin
var refreshTrigger by remember { mutableIntStateOf(0) }

// After session save:
withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
    refreshTrigger++
}

// In LazyColumn:
item {
    key(refreshTrigger) {
        TodaySummaryCard(database, selectedCategory)
    }
}
```

### 2. **Timer Stopping When Switching Categories** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** When timer was running and user clicked another category, the timer would stop.

**Root Cause:**
- No protection against category changes during active tracking
- `selectedCategory` state change was affecting running timer

**Solution:**
- Added `isRunning` check in category selection
- Disabled category selection while timer is running
- Store `trackingCategoryId` separately to prevent race conditions
- Show informative message: "⏱️ Timer is running. Stop to change category."

**Code Changes:**
```kotlin
var trackingCategoryId by remember { mutableLongStateOf(0L) }

onSelectCategory = { 
    if (!isRunning) {
        selectedCategory = it
    }
}

// Store category ID when starting:
onStart = {
    trackingCategoryId = selectedCategory!!.id
}

// Use stored ID when saving:
val categoryId = trackingCategoryId
```

---

### 3. **NullPointerException Crash** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** App crashed with NPE at line 144 when stopping timer.

**Root Cause:**
- Using `selectedCategory!!.id` which could be null if category was changed
- Race condition between null check and access
- Not handling category properly in coroutine scope

**Solution:**
- Capture all necessary values BEFORE launching coroutine
- Use local variables instead of accessing state inside coroutine
- Store `trackingCategoryId` when timer starts
- Add comprehensive null checks
- Use try-catch blocks around database operations

**Code Changes:**
```kotlin
onStop = {
    if (isRunning) {
        isRunning = false
        
        // Capture values BEFORE coroutine
        val categoryId = trackingCategoryId
        val startTime = sessionStartTime
        val seconds = elapsedSeconds
        
        if (seconds >= 60 && categoryId > 0 && startTime > 0) {
            scope.launch(Dispatchers.IO) {
                try {
                    val session = TimeSession(
                        categoryId = categoryId, // Safe!
                        // ...
                    )
                    database.timeSessionDao().insertSession(session)
                } catch (e: Exception) {
                    Log.e("FocusTracker", "Error saving session", e)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 🎨 Major Feature Changes

### 4. **Stats Tab Refactored - Category-Based** ✅ COMPLETE

**Previous Design:** Generic stats with averages across all categories

**New Design:** Dedicated statistics for each individual category

**Features:**
- **Category Selector**: Beautiful grid to choose which category to analyze
- **Category-Specific Stats**:
  - Total time tracked (all-time)
  - Total sessions count
  - Average session length
  - Current streak (consecutive days)
  - Last session date
  - Daily goal display
- **Only shows selected category data** - no averages or mixed data
- **Toggle selection** - Click again to deselect

**Benefits:**
- More meaningful insights per category
- See which activities you're consistent with
- Track progress toward specific goals
- Better motivation with category streaks

---

### 5. **Calendar View Replaced Heatmap** ✅ COMPLETE

**Previous Design:** GitHub-style heatmap showing intensity

**New Design:** Monthly calendar with goal-based coloring

**Color Scheme:**
- 🟢 **Green Background** = Daily goal met for that day
- 🔴 **Red Background** = Had activity but goal not met
- ⚪ **Gray Background** = No activity that day
- **Blue Border** = Today's date

**Features:**
- Full calendar layout (Sun-Sat)
- Shows actual minutes tracked per day
- Month/year header
- Color legend at bottom
- Empty cells for days outside month
- Responsive grid layout

**Calendar Logic:**
```kotlin
val goalMet = if (category.dailyGoalMinutes > 0) {
    minutes >= category.dailyGoalMinutes  // Green if goal met
} else {
    minutes > 0  // Green if any activity when no goal
}
```

**Visual Example:**
```
        October 2025
Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat
                1   2   3   4
🟢  🟢  🔴  ⚪  🟢  🟢  🔴
5   6   7   8   9   10  11
🟢  ⚪  🟢  🟢  🔴  🟢  🟢
...
```

## 🔄 Database Synchronization Improvements

### 6. **Proper Database Threading** ✅ COMPLETE

**Changes:**
- All database queries now use `Dispatchers.IO`
- UI updates wrapped in `withContext(Dispatchers.Main)`
- Proper coroutine scope management
- No blocking main thread

**Pattern:**
```kotlin
LaunchedEffect(dependency) {
    scope.launch(Dispatchers.IO) {
        // Heavy database work here
        val data = database.dao().getData()
        
        withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
            // Update UI state here
            uiState = data
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 7. **Real-Time UI Updates** ✅ COMPLETE

**Improvements:**
- `refreshTrigger` mechanism for forcing updates
- `key()` composables to track changes
- Proper `LaunchedEffect` dependencies
- Reactive category selection updates

**Example:**
```kotlin
// Track changes to category selection
LaunchedEffect(selectedCategory) {
    // Automatically refreshes when category changes
    updateStats()
}

// Track changes to database
key(refreshTrigger) {
    // Automatically refreshes when trigger changes
    TodaySummaryCard()
}
```
